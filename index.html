<h2> About <a href="basketball.html" style="color: red;"> BasketBall </a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
My favorite sport that I love to play is basketball. I am interested in participating in playing the sport of basketball because that is one of the most common sports played growing up in the Ludhiana City.<br><br> I've always been interested in it because it was another way me and my dad to bond together. When I was 6 years old, I fell in love with game of basketball while playing at the court in front of my building..</p>

<h2> About <a href="bhangra.html" style="color: red;"> Dance </a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
	Dance is my favourite hobby and I enjoy dancing a lot. I started dancing when I was five years old and when I got older; my parents enrolled me in dance classes to pursue this passion.
<br><br>
I cannot go a day without dance, that's how much I love dancing. I tried many dance forms but discovered that I am most comfortable in Indian classical dance specially Bhangra. Thus, I am learning Bhangra from my dance teacher.
<br><br>
I aspire to become a renowned Bhangra dancer so that I can represent this classical dance internationally. Dancing makes me feel happy and relaxed, thus I love to dance. I always participate in dance competitions at my school and have even won a few.
